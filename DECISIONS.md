# Decisions

This file records non-obvious design decisions made while implementing tincan,
together with the reasoning behind them, so that any decision can be revisited
or reverted in isolation.  Each entry notes the commit theme it belongs to.

## Python transcript script

### D1 - Language and dependencies
Python 3, standard library only, no third-party dependencies.
Rationale: KISS MVP; the script only reads JSONL files and writes text.

### D2 - Script filename: `tincan-tail.py`
Rationale: its job is to print/tail a session transcript; the name follows the
project's lowercase-with-dashes file-naming convention.

### D3 - Session resolution
The positional argument may be: a path to a `.jsonl` file, a full session id,
or a unique session-id prefix.  Non-path arguments are resolved by globbing
`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` across *all* projects.
Rationale: session ids are UUIDs and globally unique, so this avoids having to
reconstruct Claude Code's fragile encoding of the working directory into the
project directory name.  An exact stem match wins; an ambiguous prefix is an
error.

### D4 - Config directory discovery
Honor `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set, otherwise use `~/.claude`.
Rationale: matches Claude Code's own behavior and keeps the script robust.

### D5 - Which records are rendered
Only `user` and `assistant` records are rendered.  Bookkeeping records
(`mode`, `permission-mode`, `system`, `attachment`, `file-history-snapshot`,
`ai-title`, `last-prompt`, ...) are skipped in the MVP.
Rationale: they are not part of the human-readable conversation.

### D6 - Section markers: `@@@ ROLE`
Each rendered block is introduced by a line of the form `@@@ USER`,
`@@@ ASSISTANT`, `@@@ THINKING`, `@@@ TOOL_USE <name>`, `@@@ TOOL_RESULT`.
Rationale: `@@@` at the beginning of a line is rare in prose, code, and tool
output, so the Emacs side can font-lock reliably.  The markers live in
constants and are trivially changeable.

### D7 - Block body rendering
Tool-use inputs are rendered as pretty-printed JSON (`indent=2`).  Tool results
are rendered verbatim, with no truncation in the MVP.
Rationale: generic and lossless; the Emacs side can prettify later if wanted.

### D8 - Skip blank blocks
A block whose body is empty/whitespace produces no output (no bare header).
Rationale: thinking text is often not persisted to the transcript (only a
signature is kept), which would otherwise yield empty `@@@ THINKING` headers.

### D9 - Output discipline
The only thing written to stdout is transcript text, flushed after every write.
All diagnostics go to stderr.  `BrokenPipeError` (downstream reader closed) and
`KeyboardInterrupt` exit quietly.
Rationale: a downstream `tail -f`/`auto-revert-tail-mode` must see a clean,
append-only stream.
